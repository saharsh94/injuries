# Injury Classification Using MobileNet

This project aims to classify different types of injuries based on images using MobileNet. To address the challenge of limited data, we employed transfer learning by fine-tuning a pre-trained MobileNet model on ImageNet.

The implementation is provided as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), and sample datasets used for training and evaluation are included in the dataset folder.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with the model, and contribute to improve this work. Feedback is always welcome!
